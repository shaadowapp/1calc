# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical authentication issues in the hidden gallery functionality where the lock screen protection and fingerprint authentication are not working properly. The hidden gallery should provide secure access control to protect private media content from unauthorized access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with private media content, I want the hidden gallery to be protected by a lock screen, so that unauthorized users cannot access my private photos and videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access the hidden gallery THEN the system SHALL display a lock screen interface
2. WHEN the lock screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL require authentication before granting access
3. IF the user fails authentication THEN the system SHALL deny access to the hidden gallery
4. WHEN the user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL grant access to the hidden gallery content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who prefers biometric authentication, I want to use my fingerprint to unlock the hidden gallery, so that I can quickly and securely access my private content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fingerprint authentication is available on the device THEN the system SHALL offer fingerprint unlock as an option
2. WHEN the user places their registered finger on the sensor THEN the system SHALL authenticate using biometric verification
3. IF the fingerprint matches a registered print THEN the system SHALL unlock the hidden gallery
4. IF the fingerprint does not match THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
5. WHEN biometric authentication fails multiple times THEN the system SHALL fall back to alternative authentication methods

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user concerned about security, I want multiple authentication options for the hidden gallery, so that I can still access my content if one method fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN biometric authentication is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide PIN/password authentication as fallback
2. WHEN the user chooses alternative authentication THEN the system SHALL display appropriate input interface
3. IF the user enters correct credentials THEN the system SHALL grant access to hidden gallery
4. WHEN authentication methods fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who values privacy, I want the authentication state to be properly managed, so that the hidden gallery remains secure across app sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication on return to hidden gallery
2. WHEN the app is closed and reopened THEN the system SHALL require authentication to access hidden gallery
3. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL automatically lock the hidden gallery
4. IF the device is locked and unlocked THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate authentication state
