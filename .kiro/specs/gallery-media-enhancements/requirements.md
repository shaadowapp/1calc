# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the hidden gallery application with improved media preview capabilities and comprehensive folder management functionality. The enhancements focus on showing actual image previews instead of generic icons, implementing video thumbnails, and adding robust folder management options including selection controls, sorting, and view modes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Image Preview Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see actual image previews instead of generic icons, so that I can quickly identify and browse my hidden photos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying image files THEN the system SHALL show the actual image as a thumbnail preview
2. WHEN loading image thumbnails THEN the system SHALL maintain aspect ratio and proper scaling
3. WHEN image loading fails THEN the system SHALL display a fallback icon with error indication
4. WHEN scrolling through large image collections THEN the system SHALL load thumbnails efficiently without blocking the UI
5. IF an image is corrupted or unreadable THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error thumbnail

### Requirement 2: Video Thumbnail Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see video thumbnails showing a frame from the video, so that I can identify video content without opening each file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying video files THEN the system SHALL generate and show thumbnail previews from video frames
2. WHEN generating video thumbnails THEN the system SHALL extract frames from the first few seconds of the video
3. WHEN video thumbnail generation fails THEN the system SHALL display a video-specific fallback icon
4. WHEN loading video thumbnails THEN the system SHALL cache generated thumbnails for performance
5. IF a video file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL show an error thumbnail with video indicator

### Requirement 3: Folder Header Management Options

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive folder management options in the header, so that I can efficiently organize and view my media files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a folder THEN the system SHALL provide a header menu with management options
2. WHEN selecting "Select All" THEN the system SHALL select all visible media files in the current folder
3. WHEN choosing sorting options THEN the system SHALL provide sorting by name, date, size, and type
4. WHEN switching view modes THEN the system SHALL support both grid and list view layouts
5. WHEN applying sorting THEN the system SHALL persist the user's preference for the session
6. IF no files are present THEN the system SHALL disable selection-dependent menu options

### Requirement 4: Individual File Context Menus

**User Story:** As a user, I want context menu options for each media file, so that I can perform common file operations quickly and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN long-pressing or clicking the three-dot menu on a file THEN the system SHALL show a context menu
2. WHEN selecting "Open" THEN the system SHALL open the file in the appropriate viewer
3. WHEN selecting "Rename" THEN the system SHALL provide an inline or dialog-based rename interface
4. WHEN selecting "Share" THEN the system SHALL use Android's share intent to share the decrypted file
5. WHEN selecting "Delete" THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before permanent deletion
6. WHEN selecting "Move" THEN the system SHALL allow moving the file to another folder within the gallery
7. IF a file operation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5: Multi-Selection Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select multiple files and perform batch operations, so that I can efficiently manage large collections of media.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering selection mode THEN the system SHALL allow selecting multiple files with checkboxes
2. WHEN files are selected THEN the system SHALL show a selection toolbar with batch operation options
3. WHEN performing batch delete THEN the system SHALL confirm the operation and show progress
4. WHEN performing batch move THEN the system SHALL allow selecting a destination folder
5. WHEN performing batch share THEN the system SHALL share all selected files through Android's share intent
6. IF selection mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators for selected items

### Requirement 6: Performance and Memory Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth performance when browsing large media collections, so that the app remains responsive and doesn't consume excessive device resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading thumbnails THEN the system SHALL implement efficient memory caching with size limits
2. WHEN scrolling quickly THEN the system SHALL prioritize visible thumbnails and cancel off-screen requests
3. WHEN memory pressure occurs THEN the system SHALL release cached thumbnails following LRU policy
4. WHEN background processing thumbnails THEN the system SHALL use appropriate thread pools to avoid blocking UI
5. IF device storage is low THEN the system SHALL handle thumbnail generation gracefully without crashes

### Requirement 7: Visual Design and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and visually appealing interface for media browsing, so that I can enjoy using the hidden gallery application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying media thumbnails THEN the system SHALL use consistent sizing and spacing
2. WHEN showing selection states THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback with checkmarks or overlays
3. WHEN displaying different file types THEN the system SHALL use appropriate visual indicators (play button for videos, etc.)
4. WHEN loading content THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators for better user feedback
5. IF the interface changes state THEN the system SHALL use smooth animations for transitions
